 LifeTracker app (Sam's idea)
     LifeTracker app, several stopwatches running when you set them and it records and holds graphs so you can tell how your habits changes
     so when you open your phone in the morning, it's up and you pick 1-10 how your day was yesterday
     and it sends it to a graph and you can see the graph and make notes
     and make the first thing a notification
 
     
     User gets notification at a specific time that they choose in settings. 
     User inputs 
         1-10, how their day was yesterday
         1-10, did they dream
             if yes, were the dreams good or bad.
             Make a textfile/log of dream or sleeping pattern
     Save data 
     Graph data
